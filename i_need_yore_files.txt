So please be very careful but do the following. COPY (do not move) your files into the GCS_Horse_Game folder and execute these commands:

git add .
git commit -m "Enter a message here"
git push origin rdmarsh

call me at 301-395-7195

don't do any more git work for the rest of the day. I'm fixing up the tutorial and making sure it covers EVERYTHING so nothing gets accidentally deleted.

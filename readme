Here are the instructions form git hub on how to begin slightly modified by me.

The first thing you will want to do is log into your github account and fork my project. ONLY DO THIS ONCE.
When we want to upload your changes to the master, we will clone your project to my laptop or afs and I will push it to my master account.

First setup:
  Download and install Git
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email pcd@andrew.cmu.edu

Do this ONLY ONCE
  mkdir GCS_Horse_Game
  cd GCS_Horse_Game
  git init
  git remote add yourname git@github.com:usrname/Temp.git

Do this every time you want to update a file:
  touch filename // if you are adding or updating a file type this commad for each file
  git add README // if you are adding or updating a file type this command for each file
  git commit -m 'first commit' //if you are adding or updating fils type this command once
  git push yourname master

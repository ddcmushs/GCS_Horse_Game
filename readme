Here are the instructions form git hub on how to begin slightly modified by me.

The first thing you will want to do is log into your github account and add your ssh public key to your account info in the appropriate area. ONLY DO THIS ONCE.

First setup:
  Download and install Git
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email andrewid@andrew.cmu.edu
  git clone git://github.com/ddcmushs/GCS_Horse_Game.git
  git remote add git@github.com:ddcmushs/GCS_Horse_Game.git
  git pull
  git checkout origin -tb Darren origin/Darren // this will pull my branch...repeat this for all members in the group
  git branch Yourname //will make your branch
  git checkout Yourname //will switch to your branch
  
Cheat Sheet:
  git branch - this lists all the 
  git checkout branch - swtich between branches
  git status - list the status of files in the branch
  git add filename - add a file for committing
  git rm filename -remove a file
  git commit -m "commit changes with a certain message"
  git push origin branch - push changes to a branch
  more will come later
